Project Report

EXTRACT
For this project I extracted data on 1st generation Pokemon using a CSV file found on kaggle, to gather the data on 2nd generation pokemon I used Poke API.  While I could have extracted all of the data from the API, I wanted to challenge myself by using two different sources.

TRANSFORM
The CSV file was had some minor formatting issues, there was a space before every column name that I had to remove, I set the index as the number since every Pokemon has their own unique number, lastly I also renamed columns and only chose a specific few columns that I wanted. The 2nd gen data didnt need any transforming because I formatted it properly when I initially pulled the data.

LOAD
I chose to load the data into SQL because the two data sets are in seperate tables and have similar fields. It also allows me to easily query specific information I want, which would be the main application of this data.  It's a simple Pokedex (pokemon dictionary) that you can use to find any specific data you want on pokemon, in my schema file I show a few different things that you can do with the data.
